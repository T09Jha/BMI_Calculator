It takes user's weight in kilograms and height in centimeters as input and calculates the BMI Of the User.
After which it displays whether the user falls in UnderWeight, Normal, OverWeight or Obese Category.
After taking the input bmi is calculated by a simple formula of height divided by weight square.
After calculating the BMI we will take the BMI and put in under the categories to find where the user falls.
If the person is less than 18.5 then it falls under the category of underweight, between 18.5 and 24.9 it is Normally Weighed, between 25 and 29.9 it is overweight and above 30 it is obese.
The result is displayed.
